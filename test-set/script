c 1 2 3    check not there when everything is empty
a 0 0 0    add to set 0
a 2 0 0    add same value to set 1
c 0 0 0    check that both are there

c 0 1 1    but something else is not
a 2 2 58   add more things to sets 1 and 2, which must use different segments
a 2 2 63 
a 2 2 57 
a 2 5 0 
a 1 3 1 
a 1 3 1    add it again to check that nothing changes
c 1 2 3    check that this is still not there

c 2 2 63 
c 2 2 57 
c 2 5 0 
c 1 3 1

r 2 2 58   remove something
r 2 2 13   remove something that is not there already
r 2 5 0    remove something, which will result in zero bits at front
c 2 2 58   check that things removed are no longer there
c 2 5 0 
a 1 7 7    add another element, which will create new first segment
m 1 2      move first segment of set 1 to set 2
m 1 2      and move first segment of set 1 to set 2 again
