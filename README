The SGGC library provides a facility for allocating and automatically
freeing objects, such as is needed in interpreters for languages such
as R.  The interface to this facility is documented in sggc-doc.
Documentation on its design and internals is in sggc-imp.

Some tests of SGGC are in test-sggc1, test-sggc2, etc.

As a higher-level test, also useful for performance assessment, an
interpreter for a toy Lisp-like language is in interp, along with
example programs in this language.

A facility used by SGGC for managing sets of values is documented in
set-doc, and tested in test-set.

See VERSIONS for information on current and past stable versions.
