The stable versions of SGGC below are tagged in the source code repository.

Version 2018-07-04

  Minor revisions.  Used in pqR-2018-07-04.

Version 2017-10-21

  Added optional data alignment specification.  Other minor tweaks.

Version 2017-06-09

  Used in pqR-2017-06-09.

Version 2017-06-02

  Change of names from x.big and x.small to X.Big and X.Small, which
  seems to avoid some sort of name conflict in the 'rgl' package with
  pqR when compiled on Windows (though it seems like it should be OK,
  and it works on Linux - possibly a bug in the Windows compiler).
  Used in pqR-2017-06-02.

Version 2017-05-22

  Renamed set module to sbset to avoid name conflicts.  Changed memory
  allocation interface to provide both zero-initialized allocation and 
  non-zero-initialized allocation, and provided option whether data areas
  are initialized.  Used in pqR-2017-05-22.

  First apparently stable and reasonably complete version.  Not
  intended for real use, as it may still be buggy, and it is missing
  some important efficiency improvements, but is tagged as a reference
  point.
