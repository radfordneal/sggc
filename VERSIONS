The stable versions of SGGC below are tagged in the source code repository.

Version-2017-01-03

  Small changes to the API.  Now uses fast builtins for bit_count and
  first_bit_pos when compiled with gcc (or a gcc look-alike).

Version-2016-08-18

  First apparently stable and reasonably complete version.  Not
  intended for real use, as it may still be buggy, and it is missing
  some important efficiency improvements, but is tagged as a reference
  point.
