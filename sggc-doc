INTRODUCTION

This library manages memory for "objects" that contain data, which may
include references to other objects.  It is designed for use by an
interpreter for a language such as R, though use in other applications
would also be possible.

The SGGC library provides the application with a function for
allocating a new object.  Memory for objects that are no longer in use
is automatically freed or reused.  To allow this, the application must
provide procedures for finding all "root" pointers, and for finding
all pointers to other objects that are contained in an object.  The
application also provides information regarding "types" of objects,
and how much storage they require, which for the main data storage may
vary by type (according to more detailed "kind" information).

Objects are allocated in "segments", and can be referenced by a pair
consisting of a segment index and an offset within a segment.  Such
"compressed pointers" will fit in a 32-bit word (with the current
configuration of SGGC), even when regular pointers are 64 bits in
size.  SGGC is designed to allow fast translation of a compressed
pointer to a regular pointer to data (which for "small" segments is
allocated as a block for all objects in the segment).  An application
may optionally choose for objects to be associated with one or two
pieces of auxiliary information, also quickly accessible using a
compressed pointer.  Unlike the main data, auxiliary information has
the same size for all objects.  An application can make auxiliary
information for some objects be read-only, and shared with other
objects.

An application can choose whether to use compressed pointers for all
object references, or (for the application's purposes) to sometimes or
always use regular pointers.  If regular pointers are used, however,
each object will need to store a compressed pointer to itself in its
data space, to allow translation from regular to compressed pointers,
as the application must sometimes pass compressed pointers to SGGC.

Memory is freed using a "mark and sweep" garbage collector, with three
"generations" of objects, allowing quick recovery of recently
allocated objects without the cost of a full sweep.  The SGGC library
does not decide when a garbage collection (at any of the three levels)
will be done, but instead provides information allowing the
application to implement a policy in this regard.


USING SGGC IN AN APPLICATION

To use SGGC, an application should create an sggc-app.h file, which
must define some constants and declare some types (see below) and then
include the sggc.h file.

The following constants must be declared with #define in set-app.h,
before including sggc.h:

  SGGC_CHUNK_SIZE       Number of bytes in a data chunk.  Should be a 
                        power of two for efficiency.

  SGGC_N_TYPES          Number of types of objects.

  SGGC_N_KINDS          Number of kinds of objects (at least SGGC_N_TYPES).

  SGGC_KIND_CHUNKS      An array initializer giving the number of data 
                        chunks for each kind of object, 0 if the kind uses
                        "big" segments (with variable numbers of chunks).

The following may optionally be defined, if auxiliary information 1 or
auxiliary information 2 is to be used:

  SGGC_AUX1_SIZE        Number of bytes in auxiliary information 1 
                        (same for all kinds of objects).  Should be
                        a power of two for efficiency

  SGGC_AUX2_SIZE        As above, but for auxiliary information 2.

  SGGC_AUX1_BLOCK_SIZE  Number of blocks of auxiliary information 1
                        allocated at once.  (Each block has space for
                        auxiliary information for as many objects 
                        as there are data chunks for a small segment.)

  SGGC_AUX2_BLOCK_SIZE  As above, but for auxiliary information 2.

  SGGC_AUX1_READ_ONLY   If defined (as anything), the application may
                        sometimes use read-only auxiliary information 1.

  SGGC_AUX2_READ_ONLY   As above, but for auxiliary information 2.

The following symbol may be defined to indicate that the application
needs to perform operations after preliminary marking of objects in
use during a garbage collection:

  SGGC_AFTER_MARKING    If defined (as anything), the application will
                        provide an sggc_after_marking procedure to call
                        after preliminary marking of objects (see below).

The following types must be defined in sggc-app.h:

  sggc_length_t         Type for the "length" of an object.  The
                        meaning of "length" is up to the application, 
                        but it is used in the SGGC interface.

  sggc_nchunks_t        Type for holding the number of chunks (with
                        SGGC_CHUNK_SIZE bytes) in the data for an
                        object.

An application may optionally define the following in sggc-app.h:

  sggc_malloc           May be defined as a simple symbol or as a 
                        one-argument macro (not a function), which
                        is used by SGGC to allocate memory blocks.
                        Defaults to the symbol 'malloc'.

  sggc_free             May be defined as a simple symbol or as a 
                        one-argument macro (not a function), which is
                        used by SGGC to free blocks of memory that
                        were allocated by sggc_malloc.  Defaults to
                        the symbol 'free'.

The sggc.h file should be included after the above have been defined,
at the end of sggc-app.h.  It will define the following types:

  sggc_index_t          Type for holding the index of a segment.
                        Currently int32_t.

  sggc_cptr_t           Type for holding a compressed pointer.
                        Currently uint32_t.

  sggc_type_t           Type for holding an object type.
                        Currently unsigned char.

  sggc_kind_t           Type for holding an object kind (type & storage).
                        Currently unsigned char.

The following constants are also defined in sggc.h:

  SGGC_NO_OBJECT        A constant of type sggc_cptr_t that cannot be a
                        reference to an actual object, and hence can be
                        used to indicate "no object".

  SGGC_CHUNKS_IN_SMALL_SEGMENT  The number of chunks (each of size
                                SGGC_CHUNK_SIZE) for the data associated
                                with all objects in a "small" segment.

The sggc.h file will declare the following global structure variable,
which SGGC will continually update with information that the
application may use when deciding whether to call sggc_collect to do a
garbage collection:

  extern struct sggc_info
  {
    unsigned gen0_count;       /* Number of newly-allocated objects */
    unsigned gen1_count;       /* Number of objects in old generation 1 */
    unsigned gen2_count;       /* Number of objects in old generation 2.
                                  Does not include constants */

    sggc_nchunks_t big_chunks; /* # of chunks in newly-allocated big objects */

} sggc_info;

Finally, the sggc.h file will declare prototypes (or macros, or static
inline definitions) for the functions documented below, some of which
may be used by the application, others of which must be defined by the
application for use by SGGC.


FUNCTIONS PROVIDED BY SGGC TO THE APPLICATION

The SGGC library provides an application with the functions (or
macros) below, which have (if functions) prototypes as shown:

  sggc_type_t SGGC_TYPE (sggc_cptr_t cptr)

    Returns the type of the object whose compressed pointer is passed,
    an integer from 0 to SGGC_N_TYPES-1.

  sggc_type_t SGGC_KIND (sggc_cptr_t cptr)

    Returns the kind of the object whose compressed pointer is passed,
    an integer from 0 to SGGC_N_KIND-1.

  char *SGGC_DATA (sggc_cptr_t cptr)

    Returns a regular pointer to the data associated with the object
    whose compressed pointer is passed.

  char *SGGC_AUX1 (sggc_cptr_t cptr)   (only if SGGC_AUX1_SIZE defined)

    Returns a regular pointer to the auxiliary information 1 for the
    object whose compressed pointer is passed.

  char *SGGC_AUX2 (sggc_cptr_t cptr)   (only if SGGC_AUX2_SIZE defined)

    Returns a regular pointer to the auxiliary information 2 for the
    object whose compressed pointer is passed.

  int sggc_init (int max_segments)

    Initializes the SGGC facility, with the maximum number of segments
    being as specified.

  sggc_cptr_t sggc_alloc (sggc_type_t type, sggc_length_t length)

    Allocates space for an object of the specified type and length,
    returning a compressed pointer to the object, or SGGC_NO_OBJECT if
    space could not be allocated.  If SGGC_NO_OBJECT is returned, it
    is possible that if a garbage collection is then performed using
    sggc_collect, a subsequent call of sggc_alloc for the same type
    and length will succeed (though this will not always be the case).

    Note that the significant of type and length for the storage that
    is needed is determined by the application, via the sggc_kind
    function and the SGGC_KIND_CHUNKS initializer.

  void sggc_collect (int level)

    Peforms a garbage collection operation, at the specified level.
    Level 0 attempts to recover only unused object that were allocated
    since the last garbage collection.  Level 1 also attempts to
    recover unused objects that have survived one garbage collection
    (only).  Level 2 attempts to recover all unused objects (except
    constants).

    Note that this function is never called automatically by SGGC.  
    It is up to the application to implement a policy for when to call
    the garbage collector, and at what level.

  int sggc_look_at (sggc_cptr_t cptr)

  void sggc_old_to_new_check (sggc_cptr_t from_ptr, sggc_cptr_t to_ptr)

  int sggc_youngest_generation (sggc_cptr_t from_ptr)

  int sggc_oldest_generation (sggc_cptr_t to_ptr)

  int sggc_not_marked (sggc_cptr_t cptr)

  int sggc_is_constant (sggc_cptr_t cptr)

  sggc_cptr_t sggc_constant (sggc_type_t type, sggc_kind_t kind, 
                             set_bits_t bits, char *data, 
                             char *aux1, char *aux2)


FUNCTIONS THE APPLICATION MUST PROVIDE TO SGGC

The application defines the following functions, which are called from
the SGGC library functions:

  sggc_kind_t sggc_kind (sggc_type_t type, sggc_length_t length)

  sggc_nchunks_t sggc_nchunks (sggc_type_t type, sggc_length_t length)

  void sggc_find_root_ptrs (void)

  void sggc_find_object_ptrs (sggc_cptr_t cptr)

  char *sggc_aux1_read_only (sggc_kind_t kind)  (if def SGGC_AUX1_READ_ONLY)

  char *sggc_aux2_read_only (sggc_kind_t kind)  (if def SGGC_AUX2_READ_ONLY)

  void sggc_after_marking (int level, int rep)  (if def SGGC_AFTER_MARKING)
